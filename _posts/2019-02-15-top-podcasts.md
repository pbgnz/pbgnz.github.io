## My top 5 tech podcasts

Finding a great developer podcast isn’t as easy as it used to be. There are literally hundreds these days, with new shows starting every week and old ones giving their final farewell.

So if you’re on the hunt for a new podcast, where do you even start? After failing to decode iTunes’ terrible search function and reading all the “Ultimate Developer Podcasts” lists you can find, you might be as clueless as before.

iTunes and other lists give you too many options, most of which are mediocre and/or outdated. That’s why I curated this list.

### 2. The Changelog

#### About the Show
The Changelog is a weekly show about open source technologies and the brilliant people behind them. The show began in 2009 when hosts Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo thought it’d be cool to keep up with new open source developments by interviewing the people behind the code.

Guests include software engineers, hackers, leaders, and innovators from around the world. The show covers all programming languages, platforms, and communities. And if you can’t get enough Changelog from the podcast itself, you can sign up for their weekly companion newsletter.

Weekly

### 1. Software Engineering Daily

#### About the Show
Software Engineering Daily features daily interviews about technical software topics. If you are a software engineer who doesn’t listen to many podcasts about software, this should be self-evident. Technical knowledge about software will help you work more intelligently. The scope of software engineering is growing.

If you use WordPress, Ableton or PhotoShop, you are a software engineer. If you use Facebook, you are a software engineer–you are helping build software. On a twenty year time horizon, there is no “opting out” of knowing how software works. But this is OK because learning about software is possible (and fun) no matter your age, race, or creed.

#### This Podcast is Perfect For…
Software engineers who want to better understand the industry and the developer’s toolbox.

#### Frequency
Daily

#### Average Length
60–90 minutes

#### Where to Start  
  - Scaling Ethereum with Raul Jordan and Preston Van Loon
  - Fission: Serverless on Kubernetes with Soam Vasani
