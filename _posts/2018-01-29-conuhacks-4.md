ConUHacks IV was the first hackathon that I ever attended and where I worked on the analysis of the data and application of machine learning algorithms. 
The hackathon was hosted at Concordia University and I teamed up with 3 other classmates. We built an fantasy league web application using Astucesmedia's API. Here's a throwback to that special day, where
I slept on the floor and got a cold that lasted 3 weeks.

### Inspiration
Use machine learning to analyze data provided by Astucemedia's APIs and then predict which players to draft and eventually which players to field during a matchday.

### What it does
Takes user inputs for various possible fantasy pool configurations. That is, the members of different fantasy pools may choose to assign different values to goals scored by defenders vs attackers, etc.

### How we built it
Had to chose between Node.js and Java Spring as the two technologies we would be comfortable in using while trying out new APIs.

### Challenges we ran into
Misunderstanding of how the APIs and JSON work which made us lose hours. Formatting JSON and machine learning is a lot harder than we thought.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing despite the challenges we ran into. Having a decent idea, that if properly implemented, could have been a great new tool.

### What we learned
How to manipulate JSON in Python, JavaScript, and Java. And a bit of machine learning.

### What's next for Fantasy League Planner
If we could still use the API, we could actually implement more features/predictions based on previous data.

### Built With
python, jupyter, angular.js, java, node.js, astucemedia
