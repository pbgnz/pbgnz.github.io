I decided to make a tribute page about one of my favorite video games of all time; Half Life 2.

My admiration for dystopian novels made me enjoy every detail of my journey through City 17. Iâ€™ll let you discover this game by yourself when you see my tribute page.

For the tribute page, I decided to make a parallax scrolling using beautiful fan made pictures.

In terms of web technologies, I decided to use bootstrap and regular old HTML/CSS due to the simplicity of the project.

The tribute page can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/pbgnz/full/jrOjQq/).

Enjoy.
